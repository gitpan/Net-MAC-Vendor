1.13 - Fri Jun 23 15:01:56 2006
	* Improved caching that uses DBM::Deep if available
	* Added fetch_oui_from_cache, so you can avoid the network
	if you really don't want to use it
	* Added fetch_oui_from_ieee, if you only want to fetch it
	from the network (and not from cache)
	* fetch_oui now comprises those two functions, trying the
	cache first

1.11 - Fri Jun 16 01:06:31 2006
	* Load any oui.txt source that you like (another URL or local 
	file://)

	* The last release forgot to bump the version number. There's no
	need to upgrade since this only fixes a missing MANIFEST.

	* MANIFEST was missing from diff. I've fixed that.

* added README to dist
* no need to upgrade

0.1 - Wed Sep  1 00:07:37 2004
* first pass: there is still a lot of work to do and a lot of
tests to write

0.1 - Tue Aug 31 22:06:50 CDT 2004
	* first pass, a bit of a monster that grew out of a simple
	script.
